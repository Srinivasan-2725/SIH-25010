## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

An effective solution to the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers in India can be an AI-powered mobile and web application that delivers real-time, personalized crop advisories in local languages, using voice and text interfaces. This approach helps overcome language barriers, low digital literacy, and a lack of access to localized information, thereby enabling better crop selection, pest management, and fertilizer use while reducing environmental impacts and input costs

The platform leverages AI models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning to instantly analyze complex data sets including soil health, weather forecasts, crop history, and pest/disease detection from images uploaded by farmers.It offers multilingual support, delivering advice in farmers’ native languages and dialects to overcome language barriers and enhance comprehension.
Hyper-local, personalized advisories for each farmer, factoring in their soil type, weather, crop history, and socio-economic profile.Utilizes AI and machine learning to analyze data from weather forecasts, crop models, and previous outcomes to guide decisions on when to sow, irrigate, fertilize, and harvest.Multi-channel access through a smartphone app, an AI-powered WhatsApp bot, and even an Interactive Voice Response System for farmers with limited access to the internet or low literacy.Multilingual support—interfaces in major regional languages and dialects, and voice-based interaction option for those who are semi-literate or illiterate.AI-driven chatbots for 24/7 real-time query resolution, including support for images (such as leaf photos for disease detection)

Improves yield and minimizes losses by providing farmers with actionable, locally relevant insights on weather, pest and disease risks, and best cropping practices.Reduces excessive reliance on agrochemicals, lowering input costs and environmental harm.Increases income by helping farmers optimize market timing, crop choices, and subsidy utilization.Promotes climate resilience by issuing adaptive, data-driven recommendations based on real-time agrometeorological data.Accessible to farmers even in remote or underdeveloped regions, ensuring inclusive technology adoption and bridging the digital divide

## Technical Approach
 ~In order to solve the difficulty faced by farmers a Multilingual AI mobile app should be created.the interface of app is more convenient to farmers rather than a web bot which we have to access in any portal.
  ~the ai mobile app consists of the following;
      * Weather forecasting.
      * Soil health management
      * Fertilizer guidance
      * Predictive insights
      * Pest detection 
      * Market price tracking
      * Voice support 
      * Feedback
      * User data collection
 which we can made use of programming-languages like javascripts , python and c.
 By implementing such a digital advisory system, the livelihood of smallholder farmers can be significantly improved, leading to economic, social and environmental benefits at scale.

## Feasibility and Viability
Problem – Farmers rely on guesswork -poor yield, high costs, chemical misuse.
Solution – AI-powered advisory app (crop choice, pest control, fertilizer dosage, weather alerts).
Risks –
Trust barrier with farmers.
Language/dialect diversity.
Connectivity issues in remote areas.
## Impact and Benefits
Behind the statistics of poor yields and environmental degradation lie families who feel isolated and unheard, constrained by language barriers and the digital divide. Wrong choice could mean another year of hardship so this problem would made the work ruined which the farmers built with their sweat and hardwork in order to help that true farmers our project let the way for it.
## Research and References
The research based on some articles, books and chat bots .the ultimate resources of the research is our mind because we have comes through many problems that came in day to day life.
